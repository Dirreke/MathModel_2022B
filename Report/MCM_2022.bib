abstract="First Fit Decreasing is a classical bin packing algorithm: the items are ordered into their nonincreasing order, and then in this order the next item is always packed into the first bin where it fits. For an instance I let FFD(I) and OPT(I) denote the number of the used bins by algorithm FFD, and an optimal algorithm, respectively. We show in this paper that 1{\$}{\$} FFD(I){\backslash}leq 11/9 OPT(I)+6/9, {\$}{\$}and that this bound is tight. The tight bound of the additive constant was an open question for many years.",

abstract = {We consider the three-stage two-dimensional bin packing problem (2BP) which occurs in real-world applications such as glass, paper, or steel cutting. We present new integer linear programming formulations: models for a restricted version and the original version of the problem are developed. Both only involve polynomial numbers of variables and constraints and effectively avoid symmetries. Those models are solved using CPLEX. Furthermore, a branch-and-price (B&P) algorithm is presented for a set covering formulation of the unrestricted problem, which corresponds to a Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition of the polynomially-sized model. We consider column generation stabilization in the B&P algorithm using dual-optimal inequalities. Fast column generation is performed by applying a hierarchy of four methods: (a) a fast greedy heuristic, (b) an evolutionary algorithm, (c) solving a restricted form of the pricing problem using CPLEX, and finally (d) solving the complete pricing problem using CPLEX. Computational experiments on standard benchmark instances document the benefits of the new approaches: The restricted version of the integer linear programming model can be used to quickly obtain near-optimal solutions. The unrestricted version is computationally more expensive. Column generation provides a strong lower bound for 3-stage 2BP. The combination of all four pricing algorithms and column generation stabilization in the proposed B&P framework yields the best results in terms of the average objective value, the average run-time, and the number of instances solved to proven optimality.}

 abstract = {Given a set of rectangular pieces, the two-dimensional bin-packing problem is to place the pieces into an open-ended bin of infinite height such that the height of the resulting packing is minimized. In this paper we analyse the performance of two-dimensional bin-packing heuristics when applied to the special case of packing into finite bins. We develop new bin-packing heuristics by adapting the bottom-left packing method and the next-fit, first-fit and best-fit level-oriented packing heuristics to the finite-bin case. We present our implementation of these algorithms, and compare them to other finite-bin heuristics. Our computational results indicate that the heuristics presented in this paper are suitable for practical use, and behave in a manner which reflects the proven worst-case bounds for the two-dimensional open-ended bin-packing problem.},
